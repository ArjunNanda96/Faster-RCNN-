# Faster-RCNN- The aim of this work is to study is to study the population of tigers in Bandipur tiger Reserve(india), we use  accurate Faster R-CNN  model that would be able to identify tigers in still images  captured from motion sensor cameras.we train a faster R-CNN [6] object detector using Amur Tiger Re-Identification in the Wild (ATRW) dataset [7]. This dataset is one the largest dataset for wildlife conservation that contains images of Amur tigers taken from zoos in Chin. In the wild, less than 600 Amur tigers left, therefore conservation is crucial.
